### Project Description
Our project predicts if tomorrow is declared a holiday or not.It uses the rain data of past red-alerts on which holiday was given

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Have you ever got confused wheather tomorrow is a holiday based on the heavy rain while in school/college? The collector sometimes posts about tomorrows holiday late. So we came up with an idea that predicts if tomorrow is holiday or not and eliminates that confusion.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We create a dataset that contains the rainfall dataset of three years, specifically 2023, 2024 and 2025 and labelled these data as holiday/no_holiday.The data was labeled by webscraping the collector post that declared holiday in the past. Then we used random forest classifier to train the model and made predictions on wheather tomorrow is a holiday or not.
